# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Disclaimer:** This SLA is a placeholder to outline the high‑level expectations for service availability and support. A complete SLA will be provided before the official release.

## Availability Commitment

BookFlow AI aims to provide a reliable service for both providers and clients. We target **99.9% uptime** on a monthly basis for the production environment. This commitment excludes scheduled maintenance windows and factors beyond our control such as force majeure events, network outages, or third‑party service interruptions.

## Support Response Times

We strive to respond to customer inquiries and support requests according to the following targets:

- **Critical Issues (Service Down):** Response within 1 business hour and work continuously until a workaround or fix is available.
- **High Priority Issues (Major Functionality Impaired):** Response within 4 business hours and work to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
- **Normal Issues (Minor Defects, Questions):** Response within 1 business day.

"Business hours" are defined as 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Central Time (CT), Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

## Maintenance and Updates

We will perform regular maintenance to improve performance, apply security patches, and roll out new features. Whenever possible, maintenance will be scheduled outside of peak usage hours and users will be notified in advance via in‑app notifications or email.

## Exclusions

This placeholder SLA does not cover issues caused by:

- Use of the Service in a manner not authorized or in violation of the Terms of Service.
- User‑provided equipment, software, or technology not controlled by BookFlow AI.
- Failures or delays of internet service providers or other third‑party services.

## Monitoring and Reporting

We will monitor service availability and provide status updates through our public status page. If the final SLA includes service credits or remedies for downtime, details will be included in the final document.

## Contact

For any SLA‑related questions, please contact **support@mybookflow.ai**. Detailed procedures for incident escalation and communication will be available in the final SLA document.
